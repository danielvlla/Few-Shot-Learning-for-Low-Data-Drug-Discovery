# Few-shot Learning for Low-Data Drug Discovery

Implementations for the following machine learning models:

- Random Forests
- Graph Convolutional Network
- Siamese Networks
- Matching Networks
- Prototypical Networks
- Relation Networks

The last 3 networks also include our implementation of the iterative refinement LSTM from [Low Data Drug Discovery with One-Shot Learning](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acscentsci.6b00367).

The Jupyter notebooks are run on Google Colab, with Google Drive mounted.
